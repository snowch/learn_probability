Now, we'll delve into one of the most powerful and widely applicable results stemming from conditional probability: **Bayes' Theorem**. This theorem provides a formal way to update our beliefs (probabilities) in light of new evidence. We will also formally define and explore the concept of **independence** between events, a crucial idea for simplifying probability calculations."

    "\n",
    "1. **Sensitivity:**  \n",
    "   * **Origin:** Comes from the Latin word sentire, meaning \"to feel\" or \"to perceive.\"  \n",
    "   * **General Meaning:** The quality or condition of being sensitive; responsiveness to stimuli.  \n",
    "   * **Connection to the Test:** Think of the test as needing to \"feel\" or \"perceive\" the presence of the disease. A highly **sensitive** test has a strong ability to *detect* the disease when it is actually there. It's responsive to the \"stimulus\" of the disease. If the disease is present, a sensitive test is likely to react (give a positive result). This aligns with its technical meaning of correctly identifying true positives.  \n",
    "2. **Specificity:**  \n",
    "   * **Origin:** Comes from the Latin word specificus, derived from species (meaning \"kind\" or \"sort\") and facere (meaning \"to make\"). Essentially, \"making of a particular kind.\"  \n",
    "   * **General Meaning:** The quality of being specific; restricted to a particular item, condition, or effect; being precise or exact.  \n",
    "   * **Connection to the Test:** Think of the test as being designed for one *specific* target – the disease. A highly **specific** test is precise and only reacts to that *particular* target. It does *not* react to other things (like the absence of the disease or other conditions). It correctly identifies individuals who do *not* have the specific target disease (giving a negative result). This aligns with its technical meaning of correctly identifying true negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it Helps Understanding:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sensitivity:** Relates to the test's ability to **sense** or **detect** the disease if it's present. High sensitivity means good detection.  \n",
    "* **Specificity:** Relates to the test being **specific** or **precise** to only the disease in question. High specificity means the test only flags the *specific* condition it's looking for and avoids flagging healthy people.\n",

    "**Interpretation:** Even with a positive test result from a 95% accurate test, the probability of actually having the disease is only about 16.1%! This seems counter-intuitive but highlights the strong influence of the low prior probability (prevalence) of the disease. Most positive tests come from the large group of healthy people who receive a false positive, rather than the small group of sick people who receive a true positive."
