    "    * $P(\\text{Species='virginica'} | \\text{Petal Width} > 1.5 \\text{ cm})$: If this probability is high (e.g., close to 1), it suggests that if an Iris flower has a petal width greater than 1.5 cm, it is very likely to be of the 'virginica' species. This indicates that large petal width is a strong indicator for 'virginica'.\n",
    "    * $P(\\text{Species='setosa'} | \\text{Petal Width} < 0.5 \\text{ cm})$: If this probability is very high (likely close to 1, as Setosa usually has small petal widths around 0.2-0.3 cm), it suggests that a petal width less than 0.5 cm is a very strong indicator that the species is 'setosa'.\n",
    "    * **Overall:** These conditional probabilities demonstrate how a specific feature measurement (petal width) can be used to predict or classify the species of an Iris flower. High conditional probabilities indicate a strong relationship between the feature value and the class label, forming the basis of many classification algorithms.\n",

    "29. **Gambler's Fallacy Explanation:** Explain the Gambler's Fallacy using the example of flipping a fair coin. If you flip a fair coin 5 times and get Heads each time (HHHHH), what is the probability of getting Heads on the 6th flip? Why do some people incorrectly believe the probability changes?\n",

    "    **The Gambler's Fallacy:**\n",
    "    The Gambler's Fallacy is the mistaken belief that if something happens more frequently than normal during a given period, it will happen less frequently in the future (or vice versa). It's an error in reasoning that assumes past independent events can influence the outcome of future independent events.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example: Flipping a Fair Coin**\n",
    "    Suppose you flip a fair coin 5 times and get Heads each time: HHHHH.\n",
    "    * **Question:** What is the probability of getting Heads on the 6th flip?\n",
    "    * **Correct Answer:** The probability of getting Heads on the 6th flip is still $1/2$ (or 0.5).\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Why the probability remains 1/2:**\n",
    "    * **Independence:** Each coin flip is an independent event. The outcome of one flip does not affect the outcome of any other flip. The coin has no \"memory\" of past results.\n",
    "    * **Fair Coin:** A fair coin, by definition, has an equal probability of landing on Heads or Tails on any given flip ($P(H) = 0.5$, $P(T) = 0.5$).\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Why some people incorrectly believe the probability changes:**\n",
    "    1.  **Misunderstanding of \"Law of Averages\":** People might think that to \"even out\" the results or get closer to the expected 50/50 distribution, a Tail is \"due.\" They expect the long-run frequencies to correct themselves in the short term. While it's true that over a very large number of flips the proportion of Heads will tend towards 0.5, this doesn't mean future flips are dependent on past ones to achieve this balance.\n",
    "    2.  **Pattern Seeking:** Humans are prone to seeing patterns, even in random sequences. A string of HHHHH might seem like a strong pattern that \"needs\" to be broken by a Tail.\n",
    "    3.  **Representativeness Heuristic:** People may judge the probability of an event by how representative it is of a typical sequence. A sequence like HHHHHH seems less representative of randomness than, say, HHTHTH, leading them to believe the former is less likely to continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The probability of getting 6 Heads in a row (HHHHHH) from the start is indeed low ($(1/2)^6 = 1/64$). However, *given that the first 5 flips were already Heads*, the probability of the *next* flip being Heads is simply the basic probability of a single flip, which is $1/2$. The previous outcomes are \"sunk history\" and do not influence the independent next event.\n",

    "    **Stating the Monty Hall Problem:**\n",
    "    Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors. Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats.\n",
    "    1.  You pick a door (say, Door #1).\n",
    "    2.  The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door (say, Door #3), which has a goat. (The host will always open a door with a goat and will never open your chosen door).\n",
    "    3.  The host then asks you: \"Do you want to switch your choice to the remaining closed door (Door #2), or do you want to stay with your original choice (Door #1)?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Optimal Strategy:** Yes, you should switch. Switching doors doubles your probability of winning the car from $1/3$ to $2/3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Explanation and Conditional Probabilities:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Let C1, C2, C3 be the events that the car is behind Door 1, Door 2, or Door 3, respectively.\n",
    "    Initially, $P(C1) = P(C2) = P(C3) = 1/3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Assume you initially pick Door #1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Scenario 1: You Stay with Door #1.**\n",
    "    * You win if the car is actually behind Door #1.\n",
    "    * The probability of this was $1/3$ from the start. The host opening another door with a goat doesn't change the fact that your initial $1/3$ chance was tied to Door #1 having the car.\n",
    "    * So, $P(\\text{Win} | \\text{Stay}) = 1/3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Scenario 2: You Switch Doors.**\n",
    "    Consider what happens based on the car's initial location:\n",
    "    * **Case A: Car is behind Door #1 (your initial pick).** Probability = $1/3$.\n",
    "        If you switch, you will lose (because the host will open either Door #2 or Door #3, both having goats, and you switch to the other goat).\n",
    "    * **Case B: Car is behind Door #2.** Probability = $1/3$.\n",
    "        You initially picked Door #1. The host *must* open Door #3 (the other goat). If you switch, you switch to Door #2 and win.\n",
    "    * **Case C: Car is behind Door #3.** Probability = $1/3$.\n",
    "        You initially picked Door #1. The host *must* open Door #2 (the other goat). If you switch, you switch to Door #3 and win.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you switch, you win if the car was *not* behind your initial choice.\n",
    "    The probability that the car was *not* behind your initial choice (Door #1) is $P(\\neg C1) = P(C2) + P(C3) = 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3$.\n",
    "    When the car is not behind your initial choice, the host is forced to open the *other* door that has a goat, leaving the door with the car as the only one to switch to.\n",
    "    So, $P(\\text{Win} | \\text{Switch}) = 2/3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Conditional Probability Perspective (simplified):**\n",
    "    Let $D_i$ be the event you initially choose door $i$. Let $C_j$ be the event the car is behind door $j$. $P(C_j)=1/3$.\n",
    "    Assume you pick Door 1. $P(C_1) = 1/3$. The probability the car is behind one of the other doors (Door 2 or Door 3) is $P(C_2 \\cup C_3) = 2/3$.\n",
    "    The host's action of opening a door with a goat from doors {2, 3} provides information. It essentially concentrates the initial $2/3$ probability (that the car was behind Door 2 or Door 3) onto the single remaining closed door that you didn't initially pick.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If your initial door was correct (1/3 chance), switching loses.\n",
    "    If your initial door was incorrect (2/3 chance), switching wins.\n",
    "    Therefore, switching is the better strategy.\n",
