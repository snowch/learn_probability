    "\n",
    "This classic problem uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate $\\pi$. Imagine dropping needles of length $L$ onto a floor with parallel lines spaced $D$ units apart ($L \\le D$). What is the probability that a randomly dropped needle crosses one of the lines?\n",

    "1.  Consider the position of the center of the needle $(y)$ relative to the nearest line below it. $y$ is uniformly distributed in $[0, D/2]$.\n",
    "2.  Consider the angle $(\\theta)$ the needle makes with the parallel lines. $\\theta$ is uniformly distributed in $[0, \\pi/2]$.\n",
    "3.  The needle crosses a line if the vertical distance from its center to its tip ($ (L/2) \\sin \\theta $) is greater than the distance to the nearest line ($y$). That is, cross if $y \\le (L/2) \\sin \\theta$.\n",
    "\n",

    "1.  Set $L$ and $D$ (e.g., $L=1, D=2$).\n",

    "    a. Generate $y \\sim Uniform(0, D/2)$.\n",
    "    b. Generate $\\theta \\sim Uniform(0, \\pi/2)$.\n",
    "    c. Check if $y \\le (L/2) \\sin \\theta$. Count as a 'hit' if true.\n",
    "3.  Estimate $P(\\text{cross}) \\approx \\frac{N_{hits}}{N}$.\n",
    "4.  Estimate $\\pi \\approx \\frac{2L}{D \\times P(\\text{cross})}$. (If $L=1, D=2$, then $\\pi \\approx \\frac{1}{P(\\text{cross})}$)."
