    "# Chapter 3: Counting Techniques: Permutations and Combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Chapter 3! In the previous chapter, we established the fundamental language of probability using sets and explored the basic axioms and rules. Now, we dive into a crucial skill for calculating probabilities, especially when dealing with equally likely outcomes: **counting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, calculating a probability boils down to answering two questions:\n",
    "1.  How many total possible outcomes are there in our sample space?\n",
    "2.  How many of those outcomes correspond to the event we're interested in?\n",
    "\n",
    "If all outcomes are equally likely, the probability is simply the ratio of these two counts. While this sounds simple, counting the number of possibilities can become complex very quickly. Imagine trying to list every possible 5-card poker hand!\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter introduces systematic methods for counting outcomes: the Multiplication Principle, Permutations, and Combinations. We'll see how these techniques allow us to tackle problems that would be tedious or impossible to solve by simple enumeration. We'll also use Python's `math` and `scipy.special` libraries to perform these calculations efficiently.\n",

    "Let's start counting!"

    "## The Multiplication Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "The most fundamental counting technique is the **Multiplication Principle** (also known as the rule of product).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Principle:** If a procedure can be broken down into a sequence of $k$ steps, and\n",
    "* there are $n_1$ ways to perform the first step,\n",
    "* there are $n_2$ ways to perform the second step (regardless of the outcome of the first step),\n",
    "* ...\n",
    "* there are $n_k$ ways to perform the $k$-th step (regardless of the outcomes of the previous steps),\n",
    "\n",
    "then the total number of ways to perform the entire procedure is the product $n_1 \\times n_2 \\times \\dots \\times n_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** A restaurant offers a fixed-price dinner menu with 3 choices for starters, 4 choices for the main course, and 2 choices for dessert. How many different meal combinations are possible?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1: Choose a starter ($n_1 = 3$ ways)\n",
    "* Step 2: Choose a main course ($n_2 = 4$ ways)\n",
    "* Step 3: Choose a dessert ($n_3 = 2$ ways)\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Multiplication Principle, the total number of different meal combinations is $3 \\times 4 \\times 2$."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we learned the fundamental counting techniques essential for calculating probabilities in many situations:\n",
    "* **Multiplication Principle:** If a task has sequential steps, multiply the number of ways to do each step to get the total number of ways.\n",
    "* **Permutations ($P(n, k)$):** Used when selecting $k$ items from $n$ **where order matters** and there is no repetition. Formula: $\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$.\n",
    "* **Combinations ($C(n, k)$ or $\\binom{n}{k}$):** Used when selecting $k$ items from $n$ **where order does not matter** and there is no repetition. Formula: $\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$.\n",
    "* We also briefly touched upon permutations and combinations **with repetition**.\n",
    "* These techniques are crucial for calculating probabilities of the form $P(E) = \\frac{|E|}{|S|}$ where outcomes are equally likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw how to apply these concepts to practical examples like meal combinations, race outcomes, committee selections, lottery odds, and poker hands. We also leveraged Python's `math.factorial` and `scipy.special.perm`/`comb` functions to perform these calculations efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mastering these counting techniques provides a powerful toolkit for tackling a wide range of probability problems. In the next chapter, we will move on to exploring probabilities when events are not independent, introducing the concept of Conditional Probability."
