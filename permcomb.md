- Permutation comes from Latin "permutare", meaning to change thoroughly ("per" = thoroughly, "mutare" = to change).
→ So permutations are about changing the order — the different arrangements matter.

- Combination comes from Latin "combinare", meaning to join together ("com" = together, "bini" = two by two).
→ So combinations are about joining together, not worrying about the order — just grouping.


**Summary by meaning**

Permutation → changing order (order matters)

Combination → joining together (order doesn't matter)
