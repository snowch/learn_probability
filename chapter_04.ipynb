    "# Chapter 4: Conditional Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapters, we laid the groundwork for probability, exploring sample spaces, events, and counting techniques. Now, we venture into one of the most fundamental and powerful concepts in probability theory: **conditional probability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, we are interested in the probability of an event occurring *given that* another event has already happened. Our knowledge or assumptions about one event can change our assessment of the probability of another. This is the essence of conditional probability. It allows us to update our beliefs in the face of new information."

    "## 1. Definition and Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditional Probability** measures the probability of an event $A$ occurring given that another event $B$ has already occurred (or is known to have occurred). We denote this as $P(A|B)$, read as \"the probability of A given B\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition:** Imagine the entire sample space $S$. When we know that event $B$ has occurred, our focus effectively narrows down from the entire sample space $S$ to just the outcomes within $B$. We are now interested in the probability that $A$ occurs *within this new, reduced sample space* $B$. The outcomes favourable to \"A given B\" are those that belong to both $A$ and $B$, i.e., $A \\cap B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formal Definition:**\n",
    "For any two events $A$ and $B$ from a sample space $S$, where $P(B) > 0$, the conditional probability of $A$ given $B$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "* $P(A \\cap B)$ is the probability that both events $A$ and $B$ occur.\n",
    "* $P(B)$ is the probability that event $B$ occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** What is the probability it rains tomorrow ($A$), given that it is cloudy today ($B$)?\n",
    "Intuitively, knowing it's cloudy today might increase our assessment of the probability of rain tomorrow compared to not knowing anything about today's weather. Conditional probability provides a formal way to calculate this updated probability, perhaps using historical weather data where $P(A \\cap B)$ is the probability of a cloudy day followed by a rainy day, and $P(B)$ is the overall probability of a day being cloudy."

    "## 2. The Multiplication Rule for Conditional Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Rearranging the definition of conditional probability gives us the **General Multiplication Rule**, which is useful for calculating the probability of the intersection of two events:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B) P(B) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if $P(A) > 0$, we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A \\cap B) = P(B|A) P(A) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This rule is particularly helpful when dealing with sequential events, where the outcome of the first event affects the probability of the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Probability of drawing two Kings from a standard 52-card deck without replacement.\n",
    "Let $A$ be the event \"the first card drawn is a King\" and $B$ be the event \"the second card drawn is a King\".\n",
    "We want to find $P(A \\cap B)$.\n",
    "Using the multiplication rule: $P(A \\cap B) = P(B|A) P(A)$.\n",
    "* $P(A)$: There are 4 Kings in 52 cards, so $P(A) = \\frac{4}{52}$.\n",
    "* $P(B|A)$: *Given* that the first card was a King, there are now 3 Kings left in the remaining 51 cards. So, $P(B|A) = \\frac{3}{51}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\\text{Draw 2 Kings}) = P(A \\cap B) = P(B|A) P(A) = \\frac{3}{51} \\times \\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{12}{2652} \\approx 0.0045 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This rule can be extended to more than two events. For three events $A, B, C$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A \\cap B \\cap C) = P(C | A \\cap B) P(B | A) P(A) $$"

    "## 3. The Law of Total Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, calculating the probability of an event $A$ directly is difficult. However, we might know the conditional probabilities of $A$ occurring under various mutually exclusive and exhaustive scenarios. The Law of Total Probability allows us to find the overall probability of $A$ by considering these scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Let $B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_n$ be a **partition** of the sample space $S$. This means:\n",
    "1.  $B_i \\cap B_j = \\emptyset$ for all $i \\neq j$ (The events are mutually exclusive).\n",
    "2.  $B_1 \\cup B_2 \\cup \\ldots \\cup B_n = S$ (The events cover the entire sample space, they are exhaustive).\n",
    "3.  $P(B_i) > 0$ for all $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for any event $A$ in the sample space $S$, the Law of Total Probability states:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(A | B_i) P(B_i) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A) = P(A|B_1)P(B_1) + P(A|B_2)P(B_2) + \\ldots + P(A|B_n)P(B_n) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition:** The overall probability of $A$ is a weighted average of its conditional probabilities under each scenario ($B_i$), where the weights are the probabilities of those scenarios ($P(B_i)$) themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Finding the overall probability a randomly selected person has COVID, considering different testing rates and infection probabilities in different age groups.\n",
    "Let $A$ be the event \"a person has COVID\".\n",
    "Let $B_1$ be the event \"person is in Age Group 1\", $B_2$ be \"person is in Age Group 2\", ..., $B_n$ be \"person is in Age Group n\". These age groups form a partition of the population.\n",
    "We might know:\n",
    "* The probability a person falls into each age group: $P(B_1), P(B_2), \\ldots, P(B_n)$.\n",
    "* The probability a person has COVID *given* they are in a specific age group: $P(A|B_1), P(A|B_2), \\ldots, P(A|B_n)$.\n",
    "\n",

    "* The probability of each event is written on the branch.\n",
    "* Branches emanating from a single point represent mutually exclusive outcomes of a stage, and their probabilities should sum to 1.\n",

A test for the disease is 99% accurate (i.e., P(Positive | Disease) = 0.99) and has a 2% false positive rate (i.e., P(Positive | No Disease) = 0.02). Use the Law of Total Probability to calculate the overall probability that a randomly selected person tests positive. (We will revisit this in the Bayes' Theorem chapter).\n",

Compare the simulation result to the theoretical probability. (Hint: The first card can be anything. What's the probability the second matches its rank?).\n",

Calculate the conditional probability of survival given the passenger's class (e.g., P(Survived | Class=1st), P(Survived | Class=3rd)). What do these probabilities tell you?"
