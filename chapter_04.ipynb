    "# Chapter 4: Conditional Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapters, we laid the groundwork for probability, exploring sample spaces, events, and counting techniques. Now, we venture into one of the most fundamental and powerful concepts in probability theory: **conditional probability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, we are interested in the probability of an event occurring *given that* another event has already happened. Our knowledge or assumptions about one event can change our assessment of the probability of another. This is the essence of conditional probability. It allows us to update our beliefs in the face of new information."

    "**Conditional Probability** measures the probability of an event $A$ occurring given that another event $B$ has already occurred (or is known to have occurred). We denote this as $P(A|B)$, read as \"the probability of A given B\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition:** Imagine the entire sample space $S$. When we know that event $B$ has occurred, our focus effectively narrows down from the entire sample space $S$ to just the outcomes within $B$. We are now interested in the probability that $A$ occurs *within this new, reduced sample space* $B$. The outcomes favourable to \"A given B\" are those that belong to both $A$ and $B$, i.e., $A \\cap B$.\n",

    "**Formal Definition:**\n",

    "            `P_survived_given_class1 = df_class1['survived'].mean()`\n",

    "    * $P(\\text{Survived} | \\text{Class=3rd})$ tells you the likelihood of survival specifically for passengers who travelled in third class.\n",
    "    * **Comparison is Key:** By comparing these two probabilities, you can infer the impact of passenger class on survival chances during the Titanic disaster. Historically, one would expect $P(\\text{Survived} | \\text{Class=1st})$ to be significantly higher than $P(\\text{Survived} | \\text{Class=3rd})$. This difference would highlight the socio-economic disparities of the era, as first-class passengers generally had better accommodations, were located on higher decks closer to lifeboats, and potentially received preferential treatment during the evacuation.\n",
    "    * These conditional probabilities provide quantitative evidence of how different subgroups within a population (passengers in this case) experienced different outcomes based on a specific condition (their travel class).\n",
