# Exercises for Chapter 4 (Part A)

Here are 30 questions designed to assess a student's ability to differentiate between joint probability, $P(A \cap B)$, and conditional probability, $P(A | B)$, based on contextual information.

---

1.  **University Demographics:** At a certain university, 30% of students major in business. It's also noted that 10% of the total student population are female business majors.
    * Let $B$ be the event that a student is a business major, and $F$ be the event that a student is female.
    * The statement "10% of the total student population are female business majors" translates to which probability expression: $P(B \cap F)$ or $P(F | B)$? Justify your choice.

    ```{admonition} Answer
    :class: dropdown
    This represents $P(B \cap F) = 0.10$. The phrase "10% of the total student population are female business majors" indicates the intersection of the two events â€“ students who belong to *both* categories out of the entire population.
    ```

2.  **Retail Discounts:** A retail outlet notes that 45% of its sales are for electronic items. Among all sales, 15% consist of discounted electronics.
    * Let $E$ be the event that a sale is for electronics, and $D$ be the event that a sale is discounted.
    * The figure "15% of all sales consist of discounted electronics" relates to which probability: $P(E \cap D)$ or $P(D|E)$? Provide the notation and the value.

    ```{admonition} Answer
    :class: dropdown
    This represents $P(E \cap D)$, specifically $P(\text{Electronics} \cap \text{Discounted}) = 0.15$. The phrasing "15% of all sales consist of discounted electronics" implies these sales meet both criteria simultaneously out of all possible sales.
    ```

3.  **Customer Loyalty:** A recent survey indicated that 60% of customers were satisfied with a particular service. Among the group of satisfied customers, 90% stated they would recommend the company.
    * Let $S$ be the event that a customer was satisfied, and $R$ be the event that a customer would recommend the company.
    * The information "Among the group of satisfied customers, 90% stated they would recommend the company" is an example of what type of probability? Express this as $P(A \cap B)$ or $P(A | B)$ using the defined events.

    ```{admonition} Answer
    :class: dropdown
    This represents a conditional probability, $P(R | S) = 0.90$. The phrase "Among the group of satisfied customers" restricts the sample space to only those who were satisfied, which is the hallmark of conditional probability.
    ```

4.  **Regional Climate:** For a specific region, the probability of rain on any day is 0.70. Given that it is raining, the probability of experiencing high humidity is 0.80.
